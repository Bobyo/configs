configs
=======

configs, shortcuts, aliases, settings - useful (for me) stuff

.bash_profile - aliases and functions to speed up bash/shell working
.gitconfig - same as above but with git

User settings in Sublime Text 2 are not replaced during reinstall/update
Preferences.sublime-settings - paste into Preferences>Settings - User
Default (Windows).sublime-keymap - paste into Preferences>Key Bindings - User
